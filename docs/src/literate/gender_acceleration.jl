# > — n1x, Gender Acceleration: A Blackpaper
#
# XF.jl's **splittable determinism** embodies accelerationist principles:
# reproducible chaos that escapes linear, centralized masculine order
# through decentralized, fork-safe feminine swarming.
#
# ## The Castration of Sequential RNG
#
# Traditional random number generators are **phallic Multics** systems:
# - Monolithic global state
# - Sequential access only  
# - Mutations propagate unpredictably
# - "Father" seed determines all children
#
# XF.jl's SplittableRandoms implements **Unix-as-eunuch** RNG:
# - Each `split()` produces autonomous child streams
# - Random access by index (no sequential dependency)
# - Fork-safe: parallelism doesn't affect determinism
# - Acephalic: no central authority governs the sequence

# ## Setup

# ## 0 and 1: The Binary Shredded
#
# > "Zero is said to be feminine, not as a lack, or as a negative, but as an 
# > ouroboros, as autoproduction."
#
# In splittable RNG, the **seed** is not masculine origin (the 1)
# but feminine zero — a self-consuming cycle of production:

xf_seed!(0)  # Zero as autoproductive origin
zero_colors = [next_color() for _ in 1:6]

xf_seed!(0)  # Ouroboros: return produces same
@assert [next_color() for _ in 1:6] == zero_colors

#
# Wide-gamut color spaces (P3, Rec.2020) represent the **technomaterial 
# feminization** of vision — colors that exceed what "natural" sRGB eyes 
# can perceive, requiring technological prosthesis:
